## Sickness

Minor ailments that would be considered trivial in other occupations may have serious implications for a pilot. This includes one of the physiological effects of the common cold which can prevent the free exchange of air necessary to equalise pressure changes on the sinuses/ear drum as cabin altitude varies. This can be extremely painful and potentially incapacitating –do not rely on the Texan’s pressurised cockpit to assist! The regulations governing aircrew fitness to fly are set out comprehensively in the Military Aviation Authority (MAA) Regulatory Article 2135. If you are in any doubt about your fitness to fly you should consult a Military Aviation Medical Examiner (MAME) and inform your Course Commander at the earliest opportunity.
