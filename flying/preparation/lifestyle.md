## Lifestyle

Your working days at BFT will be absorbing, interesting and challenging but they can be long! Try to adopt a flexible approach because the programmers’ best endeavours often do not survive first contact with the prevailing weather conditions –frequent flying programme changes can be expected at RAF Valley. It is important that you use your down time wisely. Make sure you get plenty of sleep and eat a well-balanced diet. Flying a basic trainer is a physical as well as mental exercise and your calorie burn will reflect this. It is important to eat properly and remain hydrated during the working day especially if you findyourself flying twice. Dehydration, in particular, can have marked impact on your airborne performance by causing fatigue, loss of concentration and reduced g tolerance. Self-evidently alcohol and flying do not mix –at all. The regulations and orders governing alcohol consumption and flying are very clear and you should re-familiarise yourself with them. You will be encouraged to keep physically fit during your time at BFT; indeed PT sessions will form part of your programme. However, don’t overdo it –prolonged physical exercise or very strenuous exercise without adequate recovery time is not recommended prior to flying.
