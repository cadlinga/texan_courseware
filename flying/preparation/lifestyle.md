### What are the mental health benefits of exercise?

Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure, exercise can improve your physical health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to your life. But thatâ€™s not what motivates most people to stay active.

People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being. Exercise gives a person a sense of purpose, goal to aim for and a feel-good sense of achievement. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and their day to day lives.
