## Principles of Flight

### Flaps

Types of Flap include: 

* Basic Aerofoil
* Plain/Camber Flap
* Split Flap

### Effect of Flap on Stalling Angle

When the trailing edge flap is lowered the angle of attack for level flight under the prevailing conditions is reduced. For each increasing flap angle there is a fixed and lower stalling angle. The lower stalling angle is caused by the change in the aerofoil section when the flap is lowered. Volume 1, Chapter 9, Paras 55 to 58 describe how the use of a trailing edge elevator on a delta wing increases the stalling angle and aircraft attitude at the stall; the same approach can be used to account for the effect of flap on the stalling angle.

The trailing edge flap is directly comparable to the trailing edge elevator insofar as the effect on stalling angle is concerned. The raised trailing edge elevator at the stall increases the stalling angle of attack and the aircraft attitude in level flight but the lowered trailing edge flap reduces the stalling angle and the aircraft attitude at the level flight stall. Fig 6 illustrates how the lowered flap affects the angle of attack and the aircraft attitude. Pilots should take care not to confuse attitude with angle of attack, for, as explained in Volume 1, Chapter 15, the attitude of the aircraft has no fixed relationship with the angle of attack while manoeuvring.
