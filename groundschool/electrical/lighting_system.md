## Lighting System

### Exterior Lighting 

Exterior lighting consists of: 

* Landing Light (battery bus)
* Anti-Collision Light 1 (battery bus)
* Anti-Collision Light 2 (generator bus)
* Navigation Lights (generator bus)
* Taxi Light (generator bus)

They are all controlled by switches on the LH console, front cockpit.

### Landing Light 

The Landing Light is attached to the left main gear strut. It is, therefore, only visible with the gear down. If all three landing gear legs are positively locked down, then the Landing Light will be enabled, which provides the runway caravan controller/ATC Tower with a (primary) clear confirmation that the gear is down (NB, main gear doors’ position is irrelevant to Landing Light function).

### Taxy Light 

The Taxy Light is attached to the right main gear strut. It is, therefore, only visible with the gear down. If all three landing gear legs are positively locked down, then the Taxy Light will be enabled, which provides the runway caravan controller/ATC Tower with a (backup) clear confirmation that the gear is down (NB, main gear doors’ position is irrelevant to Landing Light function).

### Anti-Collision Lights 

The Anti-Collision Lights on the wingtips are controlled by a three-position switch, placarded ANTI-COLL OFF, 1 and 2. In position 1, the lights sequence a burst of 4 flashes (1 primary flash, followed by 3 half-bright secondary flashes). In position 2, the additional forward-facing wingtip lights illuminate to aid collision prevention.

### Navigation Lights 

The Navigation Lights are co-located with the Anti-Collision strobe lights and cover ICAO Standard angles.

### Interior Lighting 

Interior lighting consists of:

* Area (flood) Lights (battery bus, FLDT CB)
* Utility Lights (battery bus, UTIL CB)
* Knee-board Lights (battery bus, UTIL CB)
* Integral and Console Lights (battery bus, INST CB)
* Side Lights (generator bus, SIDE CB)
* BFI lighting (auxiliary battery, STBY CB)

The Knee-board Lights are located under the glareshield in each cockpit. They are turned on by rotating them downwards towards the pilot’s knees and brightness is controlled by rotating the integral bezel.

The Utility Light (aka “Wander-Lamp”) is located at the aft end of the RH console in each cockpit. Brightness is controlled by a bezel on the back of the light, which also has a push-button for momentary lighting.

BFI lighting is controlled from the BFI “M” button menu (see PFD lesson)
