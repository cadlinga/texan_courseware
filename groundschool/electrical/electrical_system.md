## Electrical System

The aux bat is an aux bat. 

### Battery

The aircraft has a 24 Vdc 48 Ah battery in the engine bay, aft, port side. It is a lead-acid battery, fully aerobatic and is permanently connected tothe HOT BAT BUS.

Switching on the BAT MASTER switch in either cockpit connects the battery to the Battery Busbars and, via the BUS TIE switch, to the Generator Busbars (with the exception of the HOT GEN BUS).

If the front cockpit battery switch is ON, then the rear cockpit switch will be at the OFF position (ie, both switches cannot be ON at the same time). If the rear cockpit switch is now placed to the ON position, it will take control of the battery and then magnetically de-latch the switch inthe front cockpit and vice versa. This is so that control of the battery can be transferred between cockpits without any power interruption.

During the INITIAL CHECKS in the FRCs, battery voltage is checked. If the voltage is less than 22V, then the BAT MASTER switch should be set to OFF and the aircraft placed U/S. If external power were to be applied, the charge rate would overheat the battery, causing an acid spillage in the engine bay.

Similarly, if the voltage is less than 23.5V, an internal battery start should not be attempted because, after the start, the battery would be below 22V and the battery would overheat when the generator was switched on. Starts should normally be carried out with an appropriate external power set.

If the generator fails, the battery can power the battery busbars for about 30 minutes. Radio transmissions are a large current load and this may shorten the time available. If the BUS TIE is left at NORM, then the generator busbars will also be powered, but for an indeterminate, shorter period.

### Starter/Generator 

The aircraft has a 28 Vdc 300A starter/generator. During start, this is configured as a motor to drive the gas generator via the Accessory Gearbox. Once the start cycle has progressed to the point where electrical power tothe starter is no longer needed (about 50% N1), it is automatically configured as a generator.

A voltage sense circuit immediately after the generator will not allow its connection to the rest of the electrical system if the generator output voltage is too high (this would overheat the battery). If the front cockpit generator switch is ON, then the rear cockpit switch will be at the OFF position (ie, both switches cannot be ON at the same time). If the rear cockpit switch is now placed to the ON position, it will take control of the generator and then magnetically de-latch the switch in the front cockpit and vice versa. This is so that control of the generator can be transferred between cockpits without any power interruption.

During the PRE-TAKEOFF CHECKS,battery charging must be less than +50 A.

With the BUS TIE switch at NORM, the generator powers all aircraft busbars. With the BUS TIE switch at OPEN or if the bus tie fails open, the generator will only power the generator busbars with the battery powering all the battery busbars for about 30 minutes in this case.

### Auxillary Battery 

The aircraft has an auxiliary battery in the LH Avionics bay, rated at 24 Vdc 5 Ah. Power to the FWD and AFT AUX BAT BUSbars is normally supplied through a CB on the FWD BAT BUSbar (see schematic).

With the AUX BAT switch ON, the Auxiliary Battery is “armed” to power the AUX BAT BUSbars in the event of a FWD BAT BUSbar failure. The sensing circuit within the Auxiliary Battery and the relay system are extremely fast and power to those busbars will not be interrupted during this failure.

The Inertial Reference System, Backup Flight Instrument, COM2 and the Remote V/UHF head (front cockpit, RH console) are all powered from the FWD AUX BAT BUSbar, enabling an IMC recovery to be flown in the event of a BAT BUS failure or BAT and GEN failures. The Auxiliary Battery will power these systems for approximately 30 minutes.

During the INITIAL CHECKS, the Auxiliary Battery is tested by selecting the spring-loaded AUX BAT TEST switch to TESTfor 5 seconds. The adjacent green LED should remain lit for the entire test period. If it does not come on at all, then the battery is at less than 50% charge and it is U/S. The Auxliary Battery has 5 internal cells, each of which is automatically testedin turn. If a cell is U/S, the LED will extinguish and then come on again if the next cell is serviceable. If this happens, then the battery is U/S.

### External Power 

An External Power source can be connected via a NATO-standard, 3-pin, 28 Vdc plug socket behind a small panel on the lower fuselage, aft of the port wing trailing edge. The BAT MASTER switch must be ON for the hold-on relay to engage. There is no caption on the EICAS to tell the pilot that external power is connected; the only indication is anincrease in voltage displayed on the EICAS.

After start, the external power must be disconnected before the aircraft’s generator is engaged. Failure to do so could cause damage to the external power set. Again, the only indication that the external power has been removed is a drop in displayed voltage on the EICAS

### Circuit Breakers

There are two circuit breaker panels in each cockpit. Battery busbar circuits are on the LH consoles and generator busbar circuits are on the RH consoles. There is a further CB panel in the nose bay, port side, aft which accommodates circuits on the HOT BAT BUS and HOT GEN BUS and which is, clearly, inaccessible during flight.

Each CB has a label on the panel, identifying the circuit that it protects and a number denoting the maximum current (Amps) that it will pass before popping.

Several of the CBs that are often used (by the engineers during ground servicing), have black collars around them. This makes them easier to identify and easier to pull.

All CBs should be in for flight.
