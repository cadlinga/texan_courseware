## Electrical System

### Avionics


![](./../../images/T6-B_Cockpit.jpeg "Avionics")

The T-6B fully integrated CMC or Flight Visions avionics system uses two powerful mission computers. Integrated navigation and mission data is displayed on the large, 25° Total Field of View (TFOV) Head-Up Display (HUD) and on three high-fidelity 5in x 7in multifunction displays (MFDs). Any one of the three MFDs can access the navigation and mission management pages for the avionics and training systems.

The Up-Front Control Panel (UFCP) provides central control of navigation, air-to-air and air-to-ground master modes from the front and rear cockpits. It also supports radio communication and navigation aid management, weapon selection and programming, waypoint management and designation of markpoints.

The Primary Flight Display (PFD) provides the controls and displays required to manage and present primary flight information to the pilots including attitude, airspeed, altitude and flight path direction.

The Tactical Situation Display (TSD) enhances situational awareness by presenting a scalable plan view of the key elements required for terminal, en route, area and tactical navigation.

The colour digital moving map display (MAP) presents the aircraft’s relationship to the outside physical environment. It also provides key flight, navigation and tactical display of information to give the crew a high degree of situational awareness during flight.

An Engine Instrument and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) provides aircraft and engine system information including status of the engine, propeller, hydraulic, fuel, trim and flap.

The avionics suite also includes a data transfer system for navigation and operation planning and a digital video recorder for mission debrief.


### External Power 

An External Power source can be connected via a NATO-standard, 3-pin, 28 Vdc plug socket behind a small panel on the lower fuselage, aft of the port wing trailing edge. The BAT MASTER switch must be ON for the hold-on relay to engage. There is no caption on the EICAS to tell the pilot that external power is connected; the only indication is anincrease in voltage displayed on the EICAS.

After start, the external power must be disconnected before the aircraft’s generator is engaged. Failure to do so could cause damage to the external power set. Again, the only indication that the external power has been removed is a drop in displayed voltage on the EICAS

### Circuit Breakers

The Texan T6 has Circuit Breakers.

All CBs should be in for flight.
