## Overview

![](./../../images/cas.png "Crew Alerting System (CAS)")

The EDM is the most obvious source of data for warnings that something is wrong, or has changed that the pilot needs to know, but there are many others, for example, the IACs alerting the pilot to an internal failure, or the IRU not yet aligned.

When a new warning (red) or caution (amber) appears on the EICAS, it flashes so that the pilot can tell that it is new. At the same time, the master warning or master caution switchlight will start to flash. Warning and caution aural tones are generated by the Audio Management Unit (AMU). These tones are at a fixed volume. Pressing the appropriate master switchlight will stop the caption flashing, extinguish the master switchlight and stop the aural tones. The system is now re-armed for the next important caption.A caption will remain lit on the EICAS until the condition that triggered it is no longer true.
