# Single Source Documentation

The courseware is built using a single source of information, a folder of `markdown` files. Markdown is a simple templating language which is easy to understand, clutter free and importantly, easy to edit. 

The markdown can then be parsed using software into the correct format for a website and the correct format for a pdf. 

This means there is a `single source of truth` and reduces the ability for information to become disjointed and smeared across various sources.

## Online Documents 

The current web version of the courseware is generated using a static website generator and is publicly hosted (for free) using GitHub pages, [here](https://cadlinga.github.io/texan_courseware/). 

The content has a 'breadcrumbed' navigation structure and all of the content is fully searchable. 

### Search Function

The search will automatically index all of the markdown files when the website is published and the depth is currently set to sub headinng
