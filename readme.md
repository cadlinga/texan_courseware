## Contributing 

You can contribute in three main ways, raising an issue, submitting a one off pull request or creating a feature branch and requesting to merge it into main when you are complete. The first two options are more adhoc and 'fast' whereas the latter is for more purposeful contribution - like adding a new section to the course manual. 

### Raising An Issue

Anyone who has access to the repo can raise an issue, this simply creates an open issue visible to anyone who has access to the repo. This should be used if you have absolutely no time to suggest how the issue should be fixed, or if you have no idea how the issue should be fixed. Maintainers will periodically review open issues and comment on their validity and/or fixability. If the issue is considered valid, a fix will be merged into the main base and the issue closed. If an issue is considered invalid, a maintainer may close the issue with a breif explanation as to why. 

### Submitting A Pull Request 

Anyone who has access to the repo can submit a pull request (PR). A pull request is similar to an issue but it proposes a solution. It is a series of changes to a file or files, which solves a problem (often a PR is submitted in response to an issue). When the PR is sent, it will be reviewed by a maintainer. They may accept the PR immediately and merge it into the main base, or they may reject it with some feedback as to how it can be improved or why it is not acceptable. 

### Creating a Feature Branch 

Only contributors can create a feature branch. If you want to add a feature to the courseware (dramatically change a technique, add a new technique etc) then you should first create a branch and name it "feature: a brief description of feature" for example to add a PFL technique into the course manual "feature: add PFL technique". Then, ensuring you are working on your branch (drop down near top of page), make as many edits to the base as you need to complete your feature. When it is complete, request to merge your branch into the main. This will be sent to a maintainer to review. They may accept the PR immediately and merge it into the main base, or they may reject it with some feedback as to how it can be improved or why it is not acceptable.
